        <p>Hello everyone, I am Andrey. I was born in Russia, but when I was 4 years old, we moved to Czech Republic. At the age of 6 I went to my first czech school, after 4 years we moved a litle too far from my school so I had to change the school. Later I went to gymnasium called <em><a href="https://www.oegp.cz/cs/">Austian Gymnasium in Prag.</a></em> That school gave me the opportunity to learn new languages such as German and English.</p>
